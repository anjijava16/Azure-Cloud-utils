What can Azure do for a Data Engineer?
-------------------
Azure Storage
Azure Data Lake Storage
Azure Databricks
Azure Cosmos DB
Azure SQL Database
Azure Synapse Analytics
Azure Stream Analytics



Azure Storage Account
-------------------
Highly scalable object store
Blobs, files, queue and tables (DEMO)
Azure Data Lake Storage, HDInsight  uses azure storage
Cheapest when no structure is required
Use Azure File Explorer, Browser, AzCopy, Visual Studio, Powershell!


Azure Data Lake Storage (Think Hadoop)
-------------------
Microsoftâ€™s Hadoop implementation
Gen2 supports file hierarchy and should be chosen over Gen1 and can be used as a storage solution for Hadoop, Azure Databricks or Azure HDInsights
Data Lake storage can be used to massive amount of data and unlimited scalability
RBAC is available

Azure Data Bricks (think Apache Spark)
-------------------
Analytics and data processing engine
Enterprise grade fully managed and secure Big Data and ML platform
Use dataframe to query data
RBAC is available

CosmosDB - the planet scale solution
-------------------
Globally distributed, multimodel
SQL API (structured data)
Mongo DB API (semi-structured data)
Cassandra DB API (column data)
Gremlin DB API (graph data)
Table API
SLA- 99.999% & 10 ms response time
Developers can use ConbosDB API or Azure Data Factory to ingest data to CosmosDB

Azure SQL Database
-------------------
Managed relational database
Supports online transaction processing (OLTP)
Supports structured and unstructured data
Could be considered as more flexible than standard MS SQL server.
Supports TSQL for query
ATP, encryption, auditing, MFA etc

Azure Synapse Analytics
-------------------
Combines data warehouse SQL, Big Data Analytics and data ingestion
Uses Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)
uses the Extract, Loads, and Transform (ELT) approach
Supports T-SQL

Stream Analytics
=============-------------------
Continuous broadcast data is known as data stream
Process streaming data and identify anomalies
IoT, POS etc



Azure Data Factory
-------------------
Used to create pipelines
Move data between various stores
Understand meaning of raw data



Azure HDInsight
-------------------
Ingest, analyze and process big data
Support batch processing, data warehousing
Apache Hadoop - Includes Hive, Hbase, Spark, Kafka
Hadoop stores data using HDFS
Sparks stores data in memory
Storm - real time Analytic solution
Kafka - create pipeline



Azure Data Catalog
-------------------
Discover, understand and consume
Support crowdsourcing
